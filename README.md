# Electronic-Stethoscope-Audio-System
This project involves the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a complete analog front-end for an electronic stethoscope. It features a Class-D amplifier system that processes audio signals using:

A ramp (triangle) wave generator

Single-ended to differential converter with PWM modulation

Active bandpass filters for frequency isolation

A summing amplifier (adder)

An H-bridge driver to power a speaker

Each module is first simulated in LTSpice, followed by stepwise breadboard integration. The system is designed for efficient audio amplification and real-time signal processing suitable for biomedical applications.
